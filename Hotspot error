I just flashed your latest rom based on Android 7.1 on HTC m8 international. I noticed that wifi hotspot is not turning on, display error when turning it on.
Also it is impossible to edit QS because when i try to drag any disablled qs to main QS  it doesnt go there.(goes back to where it was, like it was never draged).

Hope you fix these bugs,Thanks, mtayyabali.
